## How It Works

**What it does:**  
This project analyzes PDF bank statements to evaluate if a user qualifies for a personal loan. It is useful for both financial institutions and individual users.

**How it works:**
1. Upload or drag & drop your bank statement PDF into the system.  
2. Based on the bank name, the system uses a custom extraction script to retrieve the transaction table using `pdfplumber`.  
3. It checks for any calculation mismatches or inconsistencies.  
4. Then, it categorizes transactions by payment mode using narration descriptions.  
5. The user is prompted to select the type of analysis they want to view:  
   - Summary of Account  
   - EMI Detection  
   - Salary Credits  
   - Daily Balance Overview  
6. After reviewing the analysis tables, users or bank staff can decide whether the account shows eligibility for a personal loan.
